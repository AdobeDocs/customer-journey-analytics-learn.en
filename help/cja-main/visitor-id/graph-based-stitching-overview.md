# Graph-based stitching overview

Graph-based stitching harnesses the power of the Identity Graph to align identities across Experience Platform applications. This feature allows more datasets to be joined in Customer Journey Analytics by using a common person identifier in them.

Through Graph-based stitching using the Identity graph, get a better view of the customer Journey through:

* Realigning one or more datasets, each to a single identifier, instead of using a cumbersome ETL process.
* Improving coverage of a preferred identity for a single dataset to other datasets by sharing the identity.
* Aligning profiles created in Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer with people in Adobe Customer Journey Analytics.
