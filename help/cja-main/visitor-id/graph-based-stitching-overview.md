# Graph-based stitching overview

Graph-based stitching allows you to harness the power of the Identity Graph to align identities across AEP applications and allow for more datasets to be joined in CJA by having a common person identifier in them.

Through Graph-based stitching, we use the Identity graph to get a better view of the customer Journey through:

* Joining datasets with different identifiers without having to ETL data to reflect a single identifier
* Improving coverage of preferred or golden identity for a single dataset by sharing identities across datasets.
* Aligning profiles created in Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer with people in Adobe Customer Journey Analytics.
