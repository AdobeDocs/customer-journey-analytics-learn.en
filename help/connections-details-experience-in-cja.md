# Connections Details Experience in CJA

Welcome to the Connections Details Experience that will allow you to check the status of your connection’s datasets and of the ingestion process.

This status check lets you know when your data is available so that you can go into Analysis Workspace and start analysis. In addition, It will allow you to identify any data discrepancies due to misconfiguration. Are there any skipped rows or deleted rows? If yes, how many of those were skipped or deleted and when? Did you misconfigure connections and cause skipped data in CJA?
